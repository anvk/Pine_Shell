Pine.js + Server Shell Scripts
========

> Project based on [Pine.js](https://github.com/anvk/Pine) a developer friendly and easy to use boilerplate for creating RESTful webservices using Node.JS + Shell scripts.
> Can be used to execute shell commands on the server.

### Prerequisites

Node + NPM

```
$ npm install
```

### Example of pine + shell

```
$ node main
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your running web service

### Options

Same as [Pine.js options](https://github.com/anvk/Pine#options)

**routes** - array of route objects. Please refer to the documentation below for further details.  
**port** - port where for the web service  
**verbose** - there will extra logging messages printed if true  
**processRequest** - callback which will be executed for every web service request. Please refer to the documentation below for further details.  

#### Route object

> Object which sets route rules(URLs) for the web service. Its properties are described below. NOTE: extra properties could be specified and accessed through _params.route_ in _proccessRequest()_ callback

**url** - url for a route  
**method** - GET/POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE. NOTE: by default method will be set to GET for a route  
**shellCommand** - shell command which is executed on the server when client requests a route. NOTE: you can match _{{argument}}_ to a value in argMap. Please refer to the documentation below for further details.  
**argMap** - an object which contains mapping for arguments which were passed in URL, Body or Query URL.  

#### Route example

If you need to process _GET http://localhost:3000/echo/HelloUser_ to execute _$ echo HelloUser_ then your route object will be the following:

```javascript
{
  url: '/echo/:message',
  shellCommand: 'echo {{message}}',
  argMap: {
    message: 'params.message'
}
```

#### processRequest(params)

Same as [Pine.js processRequest()](https://github.com/anvk/Pine#processrequestparams)

> Callback for every route which got executed. Params consist of the following objects:

**args** - object which contains resolved variables from route's argMap  
**res** - Express response object. NOTE: you need to call _res.send(data)_ within your _processRequest()_ callback to send JSON back to a client.  
**req** - Express request object.  
**route** - Route object which got executed. NOTE: all extra properties will be in this object  

### Widget default options

Same as [Pine.js default options](https://github.com/anvk/Pine#widget-default-options)

```javascript
var defaults = {
  routes: [],
  port: 3000,
  verbose: false,
  processRequest: undefined
};
```
